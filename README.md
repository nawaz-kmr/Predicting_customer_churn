# Predicting_customer_churn


•
Did in depth exploratory data analysis on the churn dataset and got valuable insight
for the machine learning model.
•

Created a machine learning model using a bunch of algorithms (LR, KNN, SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn based on historical
data.GB classifier achieved 8% decrease in the overall churn rate
